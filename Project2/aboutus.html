        <p>How it all Began...
        In 1997, Master Chef Pierre DeBois moved to Utah from New York where he owned and managed a small restaurant called Ma Maison (My Home).  His restaurant specialized in French Nouvelle cuisine.  Once in Salt Lake City, he realized that the average Utahan doesn't have much appreciation for high cuisine.  
        <p>Pierre and his family were invited to a neighborhood block party one summer and it was there he had his first encounter with Native Cooking of Utah.  Pierre noticed how much the locals enjoyed the items brought to this pot luck dinner.  They often went back for seconds or thirds.  
        <p>How could he capture this enthusiasm for eating and translate it into his own cooking?  In order to answer this question, he began a year long quest to find out the reason for the success of Utah cuisine.</p>

        <h2>Discoveries</h2>
        Pierre discovered there are some things that set apart Utah cooking from others:
        <ul>
        <li>Simplicity in preparation</li>
        <li>Inexpensive ingredients</li>
        <li>variations available</li>
        <li>Feeds large amounts of people</li> 
        <li>Ease of Serving and Cleanup</li>
        </ul>

        Native Cooking of Utah Goes Online...
        So in 2010, Pierre DeBois began gathering recipes for an online cookbook titled: Native Cooking of Utah.  Everywhere he could, he begged, borrowed or stole the secret recipes of popular Utah cooks. Many of these recipes had been handed down from generation to generation.  In fact, the most well known recipe for green jello even was honored with its own Olympic pin.

        Looking to the Future...
        Native Cooking of Utah has become one of the most popular cooking sites in the Western U.S. with over 10,000 hits per week.  Chef Pierre DeBois has plans to expand the site to include cooking utensils and kitchen accessories used or hand-made by native Utahans.  Not only can you use this web site to help you to create true Utahan cuisine, now you can look the part.  You will find these added treats online after January, 2013.

            <p>My name is Daisy Daniels and I have enjoyed using the recipes I have found at your web site.  I thought I already knew how to cook like a Utahan, but I have been able to expand my repertoire after trying out some of your more unusual offerings.  I like how these recipes are inexpensive to prepare, and they serve lots of people.  The clean up usually is painless as well.  I loved your green jello recipe.  My family makes sure we never have leftovers when I fix this one.
            Thanks for everything,

            <p>Whenever I am at a loss about what to cook for dinner, I just go to your web site and I can always find an answer. The ingredients of your recipes are always reasonably priced so I won't have to worry about busting my budget.  I was nervous about trying to make my own ice cream, but your Bear Lake Raspberry recipe made me brave enough to try it.  The step by step directions were easy to follow and my kids really loved the ice cream.  I am attaching a photo.
            I scream for your ice cream,

            <p>Real men are not afraid to try Dutch oven cooking.  I made an investment in equipment, but it sat in my garage until I found your wonderful recipes online.  Now, I am a hit at family reunions and campouts.  I have tried main dishes, deserts, and even baked rolls.  My next attempt will be lasagna.  Thanks for giving me the courage to try cooking the old fashioned way.
            Warmly yours,
